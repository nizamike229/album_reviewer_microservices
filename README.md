# 🌐 Microservices Architecture Project

This project implements a modern microservices architecture using .NET 9.0, demonstrating best practices in distributed systems design and implementation.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The solution is organized into the following main components:

### 🚪 Gateway
- **ApiGateway** - Reverse proxy implementation using YARP, handling routing and authentication of requests to internal services.
  - 🔐 JWT authentication integration
  - 📄 Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
  - 🔁 Request routing and load balancing

### 🧩 Services

#### 🛡️ Authentication Service
- **AuthService** - Handles user authentication and authorization
  - 🔑 JWT token generation and validation
  - 👤 User management
  - 🗄️ SQLite database integration
  - 🔗 gRPC service implementation for inter-service communication
  - 🧂 BCrypt for password hashing

#### 📝 Review Service
- Clean Architecture implementation with separate projects:
  - **ReviewService.Domain** - Contains business entities and interfaces
  - **ReviewService.Application** - Business logic and use cases
  - **ReviewService.Infrastructure** - Data access and external service implementations
  - **ReviewService.Web** - API controllers and configuration
  - Features:
    - 🔐 Protected endpoints with JWT authentication
    - 🗄️ SQLite database for data persistence
    - 📡 gRPC client for auth service communication

### 💻 Frontend
- **presentation** - Modern web application built with:
  - 🧬 Svelte framework
  - ⚡ Vite build tool
  - 🔧 Custom API client
  - 👥 User authentication integration
  - ⭐ Star rating component

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **.NET 9.0** - Latest version of the .NET platform
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for database operations
- **SQLite** - Lightweight database for each service
- **JWT** - Token-based authentication
- **gRPC** - High-performance RPC framework for inter-service communication
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** - API documentation and testing
- **YARP** - Reverse proxy for API Gateway
- **Svelte** - Frontend framework
- **Vite** - Next generation frontend tooling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- 🟣 .NET 9.0 SDK
- 🟢 Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- 🛠️ IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, or VS Code)

### ⚙️ Setup

1. 🧬 Clone the repository
2. ▶️ Start the services:
   ```bash
   # Start Auth Service
   cd Services/AuthService
   dotnet run

   # Start Review Service
   cd Services/ReviewService/ReviewService.Web
   dotnet run

   # Start API Gateway
   cd Gateway/ApiGateway
   dotnet run
   ```

3. ▶️ Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd presentation
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
